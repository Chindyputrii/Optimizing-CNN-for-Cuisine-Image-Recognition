# Optimizing-CNN-for-Cuisine-Image-Recognition
This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) optimized for Padang cuisine image recognition. The model is trained using a Kaggle dataset with nine food categories and incorporates Adam optimizer and dropout regularization to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting.

Features:
✅ CNN architecture with multiple convolutional layers
✅ Comparison of different optimizers: Adam, Adagrad, SGD
✅ Dropout regularization with various rates (0.2, 0.3, 0.5)
✅ Achieves 87% accuracy on training data and 76% validation accuracy
✅ Preprocessing techniques including image augmentation

Dataset:
The dataset consists of 993 images categorized into:
🍛 Rendang
🍗 Ayam Pop, Ayam Goreng
🥩 Dendeng Batakok
🐟 Gulai Ikan, Gulai Tambusu, Gulai Tunjang
🥚 Telur Dadar, Telur Balado
